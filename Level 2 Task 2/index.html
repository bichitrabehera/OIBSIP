        <p>"Self-confidence has always been one of my good qualities. I’m always very confident. It’s not like I’ve
            played 10 matches and scored in nine of them, but I always believe in my ability to score runs and back
            myself." – <spam class="name">M.S. Dhoni</spam></p>

        <p>"<span>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</span>, widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers of all time, is an
            epitome of
            resilience, leadership, and calmness under pressure. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, India, Dhoni’s rise
            from a small-town boy to a global icon is a tale of determination and hard work. Known as "Captain Cool," he
            redefined Indian cricket with his sharp tactical acumen and unmatched finishing ability. Under his
            captaincy, India achieved unprecedented success, including winning the <span class="Trophy">2007 T20 World
                Cup</span>, the <span class="Trophy">2011 ICC
                Cricket World Cup</span>, and the <span class="Trophy"> 2013 ICC Champions Trophy</span>. Off the field,
            Dhoni is admired for his
            humility, his
            passion for motorcycles, and his dedication to the nation, even serving as an <span class="Army">honorary
                Lieutenant Colonel in
                the Indian Army</span>. Dhoni’s legacy is not just about records but about the inspiration he provides
            to millions
            worldwide, proving that dreams can be achieved with perseverance and self-belief."</p>
